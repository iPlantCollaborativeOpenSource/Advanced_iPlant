Advanced iPlant: The Agave APIs
===============================
Overview
--------
iPlant offers a set of APIs, known as the Agave APIs. They allow you scriptable access to:

* Use applications published by iPlant and your colleagues
* Manage and use data in the iPlant Data Store
* Bring your own applications into iPlant
* Bring your own computing and storage resources into iPlant
* Share nearly any data or resource in iPlant with other people
* Share nearly any data or resource on your own computing and storage resources with other people

In the following exercises, you will bring resources from Amazon Web Services into iPlant, run applications on them, store the results in iPlant Data Store (iDS), and share those results with a friend.
